	In a world where you and I exist, you may or may not know about my existence. I yearn for you, think of you, and wish for the best for you. You touched my dull heart and left it glowing endlessly. You got me feeling a spark I never felt before. Day by day, you run through my mind and give me reason to look forward to something positive. 
	If I were to choose someone who I would want to be with until the end of time, it would be none other than you. From your physical appearances to your attitude and personality, you are perfect in every way. Your smile is a sight worth looking at than every other landscape in foreign lands. Your voice is a melody worth listening to every day. No man, not even I, deserves to be with somebody as phenomenal as you, but I just want you to know how much it would mean to me to spend at least a day with you as my queen. You are my world, my everything, and my missing piece. Nothing in this world will ever prevent me from my love for you.
