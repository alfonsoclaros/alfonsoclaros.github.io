	You dedicated the rest of your life to raise me to be the best that I can be throughout my whole life. For all my years of living, you have unconditionally given me strength, encouragement, support and love and helped me throughout the hardest of times. Despite all the flaws I have made and the times I have infuriated you through my words and actions, you forgave me each time and instead, helped me learn from them and develop. You have always been there for me through thick and thin. No matter how difficult it was to balance your time for your children and for yourself, you were more than willing to sacrifice your time to take care of us. Keeping us happy, healthy, strong and wise was definitely not easy, yet you managed to give us everything we needed. 
	Someday, I want to give you back all the love and support you have given me and take care of you once you no longer have the capability to do so. All the memories you have made with me are forever embedded in me and are to be passed on to my future children. I want to thank you for cooking me the best food, cleaning my messes, bringing me to the best of places, understanding me, educating me, guiding me, making sacrifices, and most of all, teaching me how to love. Oh how I wish you would live forever.
